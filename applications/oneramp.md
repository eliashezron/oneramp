## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance in Sub-Saharan Africa through seamless on-and-offramping solutions.

Oneramp is a crypto on-and-offramping solution designed for Sub-Saharan Africa, empowering users to effortlessly buy and sell cryptocurrencies using mobile money and bank transfers. Operating in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Nigeria, and Ghana, Oneramp integrates with local financial systems to enable users to transact with popular blockchain networks, including StarkNet, Celo, Polygon, and Base. Our platform addresses the unique challenges of financial inclusion in the region, offering a user-friendly and secure gateway for individuals and businesses to participate in the global crypto economy.

Our vision is to integrate Oneramp with the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling seamless on-and-offramping capabilities for USDC and USDT on the Polkadot Asset hub, and Facilitate crypto to fiat payments using their stable coins, enabling financial solutions, including support for DeFi, remittances, and decentralized commerce in Sub-Saharan Africa.

As a team deeply rooted in Sub-Saharan Africa, we understand the region's unique challenges and opportunities for financial inclusion. The Polkadot ecosystem aligns with our mission to democratize access to blockchain technology by offering interoperable and scalable solutions. We see Polkadot as a critical partner in our journey to reduce barriers to entry, enhance user access to decentralized services, and foster economic empowerment across the region. Through this project, we aim to bring the benefits of the Polkadot ecosystem to millions of underserved individuals and businesses, creating a sustainable bridge between traditional and decentralized finance.

### Project Details

here is the oneramp [project demo](https://youtu.be/N7O2s7tmJZ8)
Here’s a quick overview of the user journey when buying/selling stablecoins on OneRamp:

- The user navigates to the OneRamp platform via a mobile or web browser.
- They select the blockchain they want to use (polkadot).
- The user connects their crypto wallet.
- They enter the amount of USDC/USDT they wish to buy/sell.
- The user makes a payment using mobile money/transfers stablecoins from their wallet.
- Finally, they receive USDC in their connected wallet/ receive mobile money to their mobile phone contact.
here is the architecture of the processes

### Ecosystem Fit

Oneramp fits into the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama ecosystem as a critical on-and-offramping solution tailored for Sub-Saharan Africa. By bridging the gap between crypto and traditional financial systems, Oneramp simplifies access to Stablecoins that can then be swapped for DOT, KSM, and assets within parachains, enabling seamless transactions between decentralized platforms and local payment methods like mobile money and bank transfers. This integration empowers the ecosystem by onboarding users from a region with rapidly growing crypto adoption while supporting developers and dApps in expanding their user base.

Our target markets includes wallets, developers and parachain teams seeking to grow in African markets, dApp builders requiring accessible on-and-offramping solutions, wallet providers integrating Polkadot assets, and end users who need a simple way to transact using their preferred local payment methods. Oneramp addresses critical needs such as financial inclusion for underbanked and unbanked populations, enhanced accessibility to decentralized financial services, and liquidity bridging for DOT, KSM, and other Polkadot assets. It also supports developer adoption by providing ready-to-integrate infrastructure for parachains and dApps.

The need for Oneramp was identified through market research and direct user feedback. Sub-Saharan Africa ranks among the highest in global crypto adoption, driven by remittances and financial access gaps. Oneramp’s existing operations in six African countries, with over 5000 users and $130,000 in transaction volume, demonstrate the demand for localized payment solutions. Reports such as the [Chainalysis Africa Crypto Adoption](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/africa-cryptocurrency-adoption/) and GSMA Mobile Money studies(https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-for-development/gsma_resources/state-of-the-industry-report-on-mobile-money-2023-2/) where mobile money accounts for over 70% of the finacial transactions in sub-saharan africa underscore the importance of a mobilemoney-cryptocurrency bridge in facilitating financial transactions in this region.

Currently, there are no dedicated on-and-offramping solutions tailored to Sub-Saharan Africa within the Polkadot ecosystem, presenting a significant opportunity for Oneramp to fill this gap. While generic fiat-crypto gateways exist in other ecosystems, they lack the localized payment integrations critical for success in Africa. Oneramp’s focus on mobile money and local banking systems uniquely positions it to drive adoption and accessibility in the Polkadot ecosystem. By addressing these challenges, Oneramp is poised to become a vital enabler of financial inclusion and decentralized finance adoption across the region.

## Future Plans

Our long-term plan for financing Oneramp’s maintenance and development is centered around a sustainable revenue model and strategic partnerships. We charge transaction fees for on-and-offramping services, which will scale as adoption increases across our operating countries. We are actively exploring partnerships with parachain teams, dApps, and wallet providers within the Polkadot ecosystem to integrate Oneramp as their preferred fiat-crypto gateway, ensuring mutual value creation. Additionally, we aim to attract external investment and leverage grants to fund further development and expansion into new markets.

In the short term, we plan to expand Oneramp’s reach within the Polkadot ecosystem by integrating with wallet providers making Polkadot ecosystem easily accessible to users in Sub-Saharan Africa. This includes promoting Oneramp through community engagements, developer hackathons, and collaborations with local crypto advocacy groups. We will also enhance the platform by incorporating user feedback to optimize functionality, improve user experience, and ensure robust security.
